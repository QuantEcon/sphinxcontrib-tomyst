This document contains test cases for elements that
are **not** directives.

Text
----

This is some text

.. _block_quote:

block_quote
-----------

This is the main document

   This is a block quote context
   with multiple lines

A longer example with nested math

Let's listen to Wald longer:

   As a basis for choosing among critical regions the following
   considerations have been advanced by Neyman and Pearson: In accepting
   or rejecting :math:`H_0` we may commit errors of two kinds. We commit
   an error of the first kind if we reject :math:`H_0` when it is true;
   we commit an error of the second kind if we accept :math:`H_0` when
   :math:`H_1` is true.

and a block quote with math block

   This is a block quote with nested equation

   .. math::

      f_x = 0

   with some additional text after the equation

and a block quote with math block and options

   This is a block quote with nested equation

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      f_x = 0

   with some additional text after the equation

bullet_list
-----------

A simple bullet list

- first item
- second item

A multi-paragraph example

- Item 1, paragraph 1.

  Item 1, paragraph 2.

- Item 2.

A nested bullet list

- first item level 0

  - first item of first item (level 0)

- second item level 0

  - first item of second item (level 0)
  - second item of second item (level 0)

An example with nested code-block

- Step 1. Example:

  .. code-block:: bash

     Example code

- Step 2.

For extended **list** testing please refer
to the `list <list>`__ test page.

definition_list
---------------

This tests ``definition``, ``definition_list`` and
``definition_list_item``

Term1
  Definition 1a
  with **another part** of the paragraphs

  Definition 1b

Term2
  Definition 2 with :math:`f_x`

  .. math::

      f_x

Can ``term`` have formatting:

**Term3**
  Definition 3

Currently this is **not** supported and only ``term3`` as text
will be transferred

docinfo
-------

See docinfo elements at the top of this document
just underneath the first title.

They don't appear to be transformed by sphinx/docutils
to be `docinfo` elements.

emphasis
--------

This is *emphasis* markup text

enumerated_list
---------------

The enumerated list from docutils

1. Item 1.

   (A) Item A.
   (B) Item B.
   (C) Item C.

2. Item 2.
